## Challenge
https://github.com/Tugark/infraweb
Main goal: Web-application to navigate along an axis and create 2D-Sections that can be visualized and exported directly in the browser.

## Deployment

Due to issues with the Github pages actions not being able to use node 20, we're using `gh-pages`. You need to run `npm deploy` (while being a maintainer of the project) and it will build the stuff locally and deploy it. Once the actions are fixed, we can switch to actual pipelines.
